Welcome!  

My name is Alexei Chernyavsky, and I live in [Astana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astana). This blog is a collection of my own articles, notes, and technical observations gathered through my work in software engineering and related fields. The content is published in multiple languages, primarily in Russian. I hope you find something useful or interesting here.
